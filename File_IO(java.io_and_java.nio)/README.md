# Description
This directory focuses on file input/output operations in Java using both java.io and java.nio packages.

## NIO/RealTimeDirectoryMonitorAndAsynchronousLogger.java
### Overview
The Real-Time Directory Monitor and Asynchronous Logger is a Java program that monitors a specified directory for file creation, modification, and deletion events in real-time using Java NIO's WatchService. It logs these events asynchronously to log_file.txt with timestamps, using AsynchronousFileChannel for efficient, non-blocking I/O.

### Features
1. Monitors file creation (ENTRY_CREATE), modification (ENTRY_MODIFY), and deletion (ENTRY_DELETE) in the specified directory.
2. Logs events to log_file.txt with timestamps in the format [yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss] - Event kind: \<kind\>. File affected: \<file\>.
3. Uses asynchronous I/O for logging to minimize performance impact.
4. Validates directory existence and type before monitoring.
5. Logs monitoring setup and errors to the console.

### Notes
- Monitors only files directly in the specified directory, not subdirectories.
- Creates log_file.txt in the current working directory if it doesn't exist.
- Handles OVERFLOW events and invalid WatchKey states.
- Handles I/O and interruption exceptions.

### Usage
1. **Compile:** javac RealTimeDirectoryMonitorAndAsynchronousLogger.java
2. **Run:** java RealTimeDirectoryMonitorAndAsynchronousLogger \<directory-path\> Example: java RealTimeDirectoryMonitorAndAsynchronousLogger /home/user/docs

## NIO/MediaFileOrganizer.java

The Media File Organizer is a Java utility that organizes media files (images, videos, audio) into a structured hierarchy based on file type and creation date. It supports formats like .jpg, .png, .mp4, .mkv, .mp3, and .wav, and creates a log file (media_organizer_log.txt) to track actions and errors. The program handles duplicates, deletes empty directories, and ensures proper permissions.

### Features

1. Organizes files into Media/Images, Media/Videos, and Media/Audio by year and month.
2. Supports: Images (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .webp, .tiff, .svg), Videos (.mp4, .mov, .mkv, .avi), Audio (.mp3, .wav).
3. Renames duplicate files to avoid conflicts.
4. Logs all actions (scanning, moving, errors) in media_organizer_log.txt.
5. Deletes empty directories post-processing.
6. Validates directory permissions.

### Notes
- Skips media_organizer_log.txt during processing.
- Logs and skips unsupported file types or files with inaccessible creation dates.
- Handles I/O exceptions.

### Usage
1. **Compile:** javac MediaFileOrganizer.java
2. **Run:** java MediaFileOrganizer \<directory-path\> Example: java MediaFileOrganizer /home/user/photos
